            I have created a website (soon to be app) that teaches you ASL and is packed with two
            games I have created,
            if you wish to get right on it, please scroll down for an explanation about each game, or simply click
            above for the game you wish to try out. But what is ASL?
            American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete,
            natural language that has the same linguistic properties as spoken languages,
            with grammar that differs from English. ASL is expressed by movements of the hands and face.
            It is the primary language of many North Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing,
            and is used by many hearing people as well.

                    This game simply translates your input, which is what ever you type into the input box,
                    into actual ASL signs,
                    so you can see how to fingerspell words, you can try your name for example.
                    It works just like the alphabet, fingerspelling is a way of communicating alphabetically through
                    signs.

                    In this game you are shown one sign each time, and you are meant to type in the correct letter or
                    your guess in order to gain points.
                    There is also an option for a more difficult game, however I do not recommend it until you are able
                    to read the signs very fast.

                    In this game you are given a letter, and you are meant to click the corresponding sign. This game
                    can be a bit more challenging than the other two, especially at first, but practice makes perfect!
                    There is also an option for a more difficult mode, but for this game, it is absolutely hard - Try it
                    if you dare.
