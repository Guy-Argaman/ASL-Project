00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.985
Hi guys, I'm Fireese and today I'm going to show 
you how to sign your ASL alphabet.

2
00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:09.900
Now we're gonna take this one really really slowly and really 
really repetitive, but if you are a little bit  

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.845
of a faster you can hop on down to our description 
box where we have a little bit of a faster paced signing video.

4
00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:17.947
So, without further ado let's get started.

5
00:00:17.947 --> 00:00:20.829
So we're gonna start with the sign <b>A</b>.

6
00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.962
So we have just a fist here with our finger up like this, so A.

7
00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:33.049
And then B we have our palm out
and we just tuck our finger in the middle of our palm, <b>B</b>

8
00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:38.778
And then we have C so you kind of just make a C shape with your hands like this, <b>C</b>

9
00:00:38.778 --> 00:00:42.465
Now I'm going to go back to A so <b>A</b>

10
00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:44.258
<b>B</b>

11
00:00:44.258 --> 00:00:46.964
<b>C</b> and now we're gonna add D

12
00:00:46.964 --> 00:00:54.470
So D is kind of the same you kind of just put your fingers like an O
and then put your finger up so it kinda looks like a <b>D</b>

13
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.470
D

14
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.101
And then we're going to go from the beginning

15
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:00.715
<b>A</b>

16
00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:02.424
<b>B</b>

17
00:01:02.424 --> 00:01:04.853
<b>C</b>

18
00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:06.480
<b>D</b>

19
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.438
And then <b>E</b> is kind of - you can do it a few different ways

20
00:01:09.438 --> 00:01:14.238
You can do it like this or like this some people even do it like this 

21
00:01:14.238 --> 00:01:17.158
but for the purposes of this video I'm 
just gonna do this so E

22
00:01:17.158 --> 00:01:19.357
and now we're going to start from the beginning again.

23
00:01:19.357 --> 00:01:24.172
I know this is getting a bit repetitive but by the end you'll know your ABC is really well.

24
00:01:24.172 --> 00:01:27.735
So if you do it with me then you'll probably know it very well.

25
00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:29.140
So <b>A</b>

26
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.154
<b>B</b>

27
00:01:31.154 --> 00:01:33.727
<b>C</b>

28
00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.901
<b>D</b>

29
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:37.706
<b>E</b>

30
00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:42.677
And now <b>F</b> you just take your index finger and your thumb 
and you put it together like this in an O shape  

31
00:01:42.677 --> 00:01:48.660
and then you just have the rest of your fingers 
up almost as if you're like perfect so, F

32
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.917
And now we're going to start from the beginning.

33
00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:51.718
<b>A</b>

34
00:01:51.718 --> 00:01:53.663
<b>B</b>

35
00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:55.279
<b>C</b>

36
00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:56.962
<b>D</b>

37
00:01:56.962 --> 00:01:58.681
<b>E</b>

38
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:00.075
<b>F</b>

39
00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:03.377
And now <b>G</b> is kind of almost as if you're saying like a little bit

40
00:02:03.377 --> 00:02:06.991
So you just take your index finger and your thumb and you put it out like this

41
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:14.779
and then just turn it like this so that your index finger
is pointing to whoever you're talking to, G

42
00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.095
<b>A</b>

43
00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.107
<b>B</b>

44
00:02:19.107 --> 00:02:21.118
<b>C</b>

45
00:02:21.118 --> 00:02:22.867
<b>D</b>

46
00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:24.133
<b>E</b>

47
00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:25.685
<b>F</b>

48
00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:26.700
<b>G</b>

49
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.043
And then <b>H</b> is you take your two fingers like this

50
00:02:30.043 --> 00:02:34.422
and I've seen people put their thumb here or put their thumb here
it's just whatever is really comfortable

51
00:02:34.422 --> 00:02:40.824
and you just turn it like this with your back of your hand
pointing whoever you're talking to so, H

52
00:02:40.824 --> 00:02:45.814
and now you probably by now know A and B and C so we're just gonna start from D

53
00:02:45.814 --> 00:02:48.717
So <b>D</b>

54
00:02:48.717 --> 00:02:51.089
<b>E</b>

55
00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:53.285
<b>F</b>

56
00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:56.223
<b>G</b>

57
00:02:56.223 --> 00:02:59.308
<b>H</b>

58
00:02:59.308 --> 00:03:11.564
<b>I</b>, so I is basically you just take your pinkie and you put all your other fingers 
down but you take your pinkie up as almost if you're doing I so, I

59
00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:13.595
And then we're gonna start back from D

60
00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:15.722
So <b>D</b>

61
00:03:15.722 --> 00:03:17.728
<b>E</b>

62
00:03:17.728 --> 00:03:19.569
<b>F</b>

63
00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.664
<b>G</b>

64
00:03:21.664 --> 00:03:23.702
<b>H</b>

65
00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:24.879
<b>I</b>

66
00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:33.493
And then for <b>J</b> you're just gonna take your I and you're just gonna loop it around
as if you're drawing a J with your pinky so, J

67
00:03:33.493 --> 00:03:37.577
Now make sure you're doing it with me so that you can really learn it.

68
00:03:37.577 --> 00:03:39.280
So we're going to start again from D

69
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.224
<b>D</b>

70
00:03:41.225 --> 00:03:42.923
<b>E</b>

71
00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:44.641
<b>F</b>

72
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.494
<b>G</b>

73
00:03:46.494 --> 00:03:48.212
<b>H</b>

74
00:03:48.212 --> 00:03:49.919
<b>I</b>

75
00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:50.923
<b>J</b>

76
00:03:50.923 --> 00:03:58.128
And now <b>K</b> so, K is you take your two fingers like this
and you just put your thumb in the middle of them

77
00:03:58.128 --> 00:04:08.615
resting on your middle finger and then you put your middle finger right like this towards whoever you're talking to so like this, K

78
00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:12.788
And two now you probably know D E and F so 
we're just going to start from G

79
00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:16.117
so we go <b>G</b>

80
00:04:16.117 --> 00:04:18.510
<b>H</b>

81
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.738
<b>I</b>

82
00:04:20.738 --> 00:04:22.784
<b>J</b>

83
00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:24.251
<b>K</b>

84
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:29.788
And now <b>L</b> is just you take your thumb and you put it out like this

85
00:04:29.788 --> 00:04:36.671
and your first finger and you put it up like this just as if you're
drawing an L making an L with your fingers, L

86
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:38.361
Now, we're gonna to start from G again

87
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.298
<b>G</b>

88
00:04:40.298 --> 00:04:42.228
<b>H</b>

89
00:04:42.228 --> 00:04:44.177
<b>I</b>

90
00:04:44.177 --> 00:04:46.281
<b>J</b>

91
00:04:46.281 --> 00:04:48.562
<b>K</b>

92
00:04:48.562 --> 00:04:49.971
<b>L</b>

93
00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:55.940
And then for <b>M</b> you're just gonna take your thumb and hold down your pinky
and put your other three fingers up.

94
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.630
And then you're gonna wrap these three fingers over your thumb like this

95
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.353
and I know some people have a hard time putting down their pinky with their thumbs so if you can't really do it just kind of do the best you can

96
00:05:06.353 --> 00:05:13.916
people are still gonna probably be able to understand you,
but this is how it's supposed to be done, M

97
00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:17.711
Okay and now I'm going to test you so we're gonna go back to A

98
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:19.931
So, <b>A</b>

99
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:21.803
<b>B</b>

100
00:05:21.803 --> 00:05:24.235
<b>C</b>

101
00:05:24.235 --> 00:05:26.068
<b>D</b>

102
00:05:26.068 --> 00:05:28.095
<b>E</b>

103
00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:30.000
<b>F</b>

104
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.930
<b>G</b>

105
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.686
<b>H</b>

106
00:05:33.686 --> 00:05:35.520
<b>I</b>

107
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.469
<b>J</b>

108
00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.457
<b>K</b>

109
00:05:39.457 --> 00:05:41.483
<b>L</b>

110
00:05:41.483 --> 00:05:42.634
<b>M</b>

111
00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:50.143
And then <b>N</b> is kind of similar to m except instead of just holding on your pinky
you hold on your pinky and your ring finger like this

112
00:05:50.143 --> 00:05:56.284
and wrap here at these two fingers over your thumb so, N

113
00:05:56.284 --> 00:06:01.735
And now you probably know G, H, I so we're just going to start from J

114
00:06:01.735 --> 00:06:04.167
<b>J</b>

115
00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:06.251
<b>K</b>

116
00:06:06.251 --> 00:06:08.374
<b>L</b>

117
00:06:08.374 --> 00:06:10.266
<b>M</b>

118
00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:11.308
<b>N</b>

119
00:06:11.308 --> 00:06:20.722
And then <b>O</b> is really simple you just take your fingers like this so your four
fingers on top and your thumb bottom connecting the O.

120
00:06:20.722 --> 00:06:24.316
O

121
00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:26.543
<b>J</b>

122
00:06:26.543 --> 00:06:28.434
<b>K</b>

123
00:06:28.434 --> 00:06:30.518
<b>L</b>

124
00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:32.526
<b>M</b>

125
00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:34.726
<b>N</b>

126
00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:35.903
<b>O</b>

127
00:06:35.904 --> 00:06:40.015
And now <b>P</b> is so you take your K sign like this

128
00:06:40.015 --> 00:06:48.148
and you just flip it upside down so now that your middle finger is pointing 
downwards and your first finger is pointing to whoever you're talking to

129
00:06:48.148 --> 00:06:51.738
P

130
00:06:51.738 --> 00:06:54.421
<b>J</b>

131
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.717
<b>K</b>

132
00:06:56.717 --> 00:06:58.705
<b>L</b>

133
00:06:58.705 --> 00:07:00.982
<b>M</b>

134
00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:03.010
<b>N</b>

135
00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:04.746
<b>O</b>

136
00:07:04.746 --> 00:07:06.213
<b>P</b>

137
00:07:06.213 --> 00:07:13.213
And now <b>Q</b> is kind of similar to G except we're just gonna hold it
downwards so like you're just going to rotate it like that.

138
00:07:13.213 --> 00:07:17.845
Q

139
00:07:17.845 --> 00:07:20.407
<b>J</b>

140
00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:22.195
<b>K</b>

141
00:07:22.195 --> 00:07:24.229
<b>L</b>

142
00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:25.937
<b>M</b>

143
00:07:25.937 --> 00:07:27.721
<b>N</b>

144
00:07:27.721 --> 00:07:29.999
<b>O</b>

145
00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:31.869
<b>P</b>

146
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:33.983
<b>Q</b>

147
00:07:33.983 --> 00:07:42.719
And now <b>R</b> is kind of you take your first finger and your second finger and you just kind of wrap them around as if you're crossing your fingers like this

148
00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:45.325
so, R

149
00:07:45.324 --> 00:07:47.408
<b>J</b>

150
00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:49.590
<b>K</b>

151
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.366
<b>L</b>

152
00:07:51.365 --> 00:07:53.507
<b>M</b>

153
00:07:53.508 --> 00:07:55.535
<b>N</b>

154
00:07:55.534 --> 00:07:57.580
<b>O</b>

155
00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.452
<b>P</b>

156
00:07:59.452 --> 00:08:01.083
<b>Q</b>

157
00:08:01.084 --> 00:08:02.281
<b>R</b>

158
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:09.280
and then <b>S</b> is you take your fist and you just 
put your thumb in the middle like this so you just like that

159
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.818
S

160
00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:16.255
So now you kind of know J, K, L so we're gonna start with M now

161
00:08:16.255 --> 00:08:18.185
<b>M</b>

162
00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:19.941
<b>N</b>

163
00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:21.717
<b>O</b>

164
00:08:21.717 --> 00:08:22.970
<b>P</b>

165
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.344
<b>Q</b>

166
00:08:25.344 --> 00:08:27.235
<b>R</b>

167
00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:28.567
<b>S</b>

168
00:08:28.567 --> 00:08:35.594
So now <b>T</b> is basically you take your S and you just tuck your thumb
between your first finger and second finger like this,

169
00:08:35.594 --> 00:08:39.253
almost as if a turtle is poking its head out of its shell.

170
00:08:39.253 --> 00:08:41.417
And now we're gonna go back to A

171
00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:42.910
<b>A</b>

172
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.072
<b>B</b>

173
00:08:45.072 --> 00:08:46.944
<b>C</b>

174
00:08:46.944 --> 00:08:48.951
<b>D</b>

175
00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:51.788
<b>E</b>

176
00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:53.853
<b>F</b>

177
00:08:53.854 --> 00:08:56.189
<b>G</b>

178
00:08:56.189 --> 00:08:58.158
<b>H</b>

179
00:08:58.158 --> 00:09:00.455
<b>I</b>

180
00:09:00.454 --> 00:09:02.191
<b>J</b>

181
00:09:02.192 --> 00:09:03.717
<b>K</b>

182
00:09:03.716 --> 00:09:06.000
<b>L</b>

183
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.258
<b>M</b>

184
00:09:08.258 --> 00:09:09.976
<b>N</b>

185
00:09:09.976 --> 00:09:12.215
<b>O</b>

186
00:09:12.215 --> 00:09:14.319
<b>P</b>

187
00:09:14.319 --> 00:09:16.384
<b>Q</b>

188
00:09:16.384 --> 00:09:18.000
<b>R</b>

189
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.621
<b>S</b>

190
00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:21.146
<b>T</b>

191
00:09:21.146 --> 00:09:25.392
And now <b>U</b> is you take your first two fingers like this
and you just put them together like that

192
00:09:25.392 --> 00:09:27.052
so, U

193
00:09:27.052 --> 00:09:29.059
And now we'll go back to M

194
00:09:29.059 --> 00:09:31.549
<b>M</b>

195
00:09:31.549 --> 00:09:33.556
<b>N</b>

196
00:09:33.556 --> 00:09:35.514
<b>O</b>

197
00:09:35.514 --> 00:09:37.424
<b>P</b>

198
00:09:37.424 --> 00:09:39.835
<b>Q</b>

199
00:09:39.835 --> 00:09:41.475
<b>R</b>

200
00:09:41.475 --> 00:09:43.559
<b>S</b>

201
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.162
<b>T</b>

202
00:09:45.162 --> 00:09:46.301
<b>U</b>

203
00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:52.689
And then for <b>V</b> you just kind of make a V with your first two fingers like this so, V

204
00:09:52.688 --> 00:09:55.063
<b>M</b>

205
00:09:55.063 --> 00:09:57.495
<b>N</b>

206
00:09:57.495 --> 00:09:59.869
<b>O</b>

207
00:09:59.869 --> 00:10:01.529
<b>P</b>

208
00:10:01.529 --> 00:10:03.613
<b>Q</b>

209
00:10:03.613 --> 00:10:05.833
<b>R</b>

210
00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:07.609
<b>S</b>

211
00:10:07.609 --> 00:10:09.848
<b>T</b>

212
00:10:09.847 --> 00:10:11.661
<b>U</b>

213
00:10:11.662 --> 00:10:13.360
<b>V</b>

214
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:21.082
And then <b>W</b> is you just take your V but you add a finger like 
you're making it W with your finger like this, W

215
00:10:21.082 --> 00:10:25.888
And now you probably know M, N, O so 
we're just going to start off with P

216
00:10:25.888 --> 00:10:28.349
<b>P</b>

217
00:10:28.349 --> 00:10:30.877
<b>Q</b>

218
00:10:30.877 --> 00:10:33.070
<b>R</b>

219
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.212
<b>S</b>

220
00:10:35.212 --> 00:10:37.393
<b>T</b>

221
00:10:37.393 --> 00:10:39.188
<b>U</b>

222
00:10:39.188 --> 00:10:41.137
<b>V</b>

223
00:10:41.138 --> 00:10:42.450
<b>W</b>

224
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.792
and then <b>X</b> is you just take your first finger and bend it like this almost so it looks like an R

225
00:10:47.792 --> 00:10:53.772
it's kind of crazy how R looks like X and X looks like R so, X

226
00:10:53.772 --> 00:10:56.358
<b>P</b>

227
00:10:56.358 --> 00:10:58.355
<b>Q</b>

228
00:10:58.355 --> 00:11:00.304
<b>R</b>

229
00:11:00.304 --> 00:11:02.311
<b>S</b>

230
00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:03.952
<b>T</b>

231
00:11:03.952 --> 00:11:06.210
<b>U</b>

232
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.715
<b>V</b>

233
00:11:07.715 --> 00:11:09.336
<b>W</b>

234
00:11:09.337 --> 00:11:10.980
<b>X</b>

235
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:18.546
And then <b>Y</b> is you take your thumb and pinky finger and put them out like this so, Y

236
00:11:18.546 --> 00:11:20.302
<b>P</b>

237
00:11:20.302 --> 00:11:22.251
<b>Q</b>

238
00:11:22.252 --> 00:11:23.912
<b>R</b>

239
00:11:23.911 --> 00:11:25.995
<b>S</b>

240
00:11:25.996 --> 00:11:27.694
<b>T</b>

241
00:11:27.694 --> 00:11:29.682
<b>U</b>

242
00:11:29.682 --> 00:11:31.612
<b>V</b>

243
00:11:31.612 --> 00:11:33.137

244
00:11:33.137 --> 00:11:34.392

245
00:11:34.392 --> 00:11:35.338
<b>Y</b>

246
00:11:35.337 --> 00:11:42.542
And then <b>Z</b> is you just take your first finger and you kind of just draw a Z in the air, Z

247
00:11:42.542 --> 00:11:45.494
And now I'm going to do the whole thing again slowly

248
00:11:45.494 --> 00:11:47.868
<b>A</b>

249
00:11:47.868 --> 00:11:50.107
<b>B</b>

250
00:11:50.107 --> 00:11:52.423
<b>C</b>

251
00:11:52.423 --> 00:11:54.816
<b>D</b>

252
00:11:54.816 --> 00:11:57.186
<b>E</b>

253
00:11:57.186 --> 00:11:59.610
<b>F</b>

254
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.810

268
00:12:26.378 --> 00:12:28.540

269
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.567

270
00:12:30.566 --> 00:12:32.595

271
00:12:32.596 --> 00:12:34.226

272
00:12:34.226 --> 00:12:35.519
<b>Y</b>

273
00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:36.851
and <b>Z</b>

274
00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:42.000
okay now we're gonna do it one last time slowly and make sure you do with me

275
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.383
<b>A</b>

276
00:12:44.383 --> 00:12:46.255
<b>B</b>

277
00:12:46.255 --> 00:12:48.590
<b>C</b>

278
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.134

279
00:12:50.134 --> 00:12:51.942

280
00:12:51.942 --> 00:12:53.640

285
00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:04.243
<b>K</b>

286
00:13:04.244 --> 00:13:06.309
<b>L</b>

287
00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:08.760
<b>M</b>

288
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.327

289
00:13:11.327 --> 00:13:13.740
<b>O</b>

290
00:13:13.739 --> 00:13:15.881
<b>P</b>

291
00:13:15.882 --> 00:13:18.217

293
00:13:20.109 --> 00:13:22.012

296
00:13:25.988 --> 00:13:27.745

297
00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:30.000

300
00:13:33.107 --> 00:13:34.902
and <b>Z</b>

301
00:13:34.902 --> 00:13:38.435
So now hopefully you've learned your whole ASL alphabet

302
00:13:38.435 --> 00:13:42.686
and if you didn't that's okay you can just 
start the video over again and watch it one more time

303
00:13:42.686 --> 00:13:50.880
and if you want to take all the signs that you've just learned and put them into a song then we'll link down in the description box below our ASL song.

304
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.558
